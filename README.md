# About me
Trained as a full-stack JS dev  at the <a href="https://codaisseur.com">Codaisseur Academy Amsterdam</a>, i've familiarized myself with a 
variety of languages and frameworks throughout the years, ranging from artistic languages such as Processing
and Max/MSP to the more abstract tools such as Node's and Python's ML/NLP and data fetching packages, and ofcourse various server and client
frameworks most of which you can find in the above banner.

While you're here, do check out my <a href="https://suspicious-leavitt-350441.netlify.app/">Ah-Advertenties</a> project to see an example of what i do with JS,
using PostgreSQL, Express, Sequelize, Material-UI and React!   ... leave me a ðŸ’¬ on a new billboard card, i'm always open for collaborations!
